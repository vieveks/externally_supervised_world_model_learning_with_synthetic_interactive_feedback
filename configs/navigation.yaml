num_actions: 8  # Also num_positions (8 positions, 8 relative moves)
max_episode_length: 3  # T=3: two actions before reward

# State dimension: position(8) + target(8) + phase(3) = 19
state_dim: 19

# Model architecture (same as previous experiments)
hidden_dim: 64

num_heads: 4
ff_dim: 128
dropout: 0.0

# Training
total_steps: 20000  # More steps for harder task
batch_size: 64
lr: 0.001
baseline_decay: 0.99

# World-model coefficient (WITH world-model)
world_model_coef: 1.0
entropy_coef: 0.01

# Logging
log_interval: 64
